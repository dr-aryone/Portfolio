# Class Practice
###### A brief program to brush up on classes, creating two classes and calling members from each in a separate function and source file.  

##### Libraries:  
iostream - handle input/output  
string - I used strings for class members such as names

##### Testing:  
Tested each member in each class separately before combining, then compared output to expected results.

##### Error Handling:  
None, this was simply an exercise in using classes and not intended to be of great detail and depth.
