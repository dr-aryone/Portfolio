#### Method
##### Solution Notes:  
I kept this project simple for the initial building stage, this is intended to be a "work in process" project as I continue to build and add features.  

##### Testing:  
Ran many tests through each operation, attempting to cause errors and find bugs.

##### Error Handling:  
Outputs "ERR" when user attempts to divide by zero.
Outputs "ERR" when user attempts to perform calculations with unexpected (or blank) input variables or operators.
